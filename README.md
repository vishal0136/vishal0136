### What I’m Building

Most of my work explores how machine learning models can move beyond notebooks and become usable systems.  
I’m especially interested in computer vision, accessibility-focused AI, and backend services that make models reliable in the real world.

### Selected Work

**VediSpeak** — Indian Sign Language recognition system  
https://github.com/vishal0136/VediSpeak  

A real-time computer vision pipeline that translates hand gestures into text and speech.  
Built to explore accuracy, latency, and usability in accessibility-driven AI.

### How I Think About Systems

- Start simple, validate early  
- Treat models as components, not endpoints  
- Optimize for clarity, not cleverness  
- Iterate in public and learn from failure  

---

### Currently Exploring

- Improving robustness of vision-based models  
- Real-time inference optimization  
- Backend patterns for ML-powered applications
